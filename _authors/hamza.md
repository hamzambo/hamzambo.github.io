<div ><p>Hamza is a full-time mammal and professional uncle who perenially marvels at the absurdities of life on this small planet. He has never understood why people go to safaris to ogle at wild animals in their open air homes because he finds humans to be the most interesting creatures to watch. He can neither confirm nor deny the allegation that he is of above-average height. Connect with him on <a id="profile-link"  target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hamzambo">Twitter</a>.
