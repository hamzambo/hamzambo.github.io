In early 2003, Kenya had a new president in
quarter a century. The whole country was
hopeful of the new government. Mum thought it
was a perfect time to relocate. So, we moved to
Thika, a cosmopolitan industrial town.

I was in Standard 1 then. The school my mum
wanted to enroll me in required 'entrance' exams
before admission. I don't remember if I insisted
on doing entrance exams for Std 2 or it was
mum's idea. What I remember is that I failed
terribly. 

I failed so bad that the school decided to place
me not in Class 1, but in Pre-Unit for a few
weeks. However, I choose to see this premature
retake not as a failure, but as a vaccine. A
vaccine against academic failure. 

The vaccine seems to have been working quite
well so far, though it has been tested to its limits
by medical school. I highly
recommend this vaccine to your future children.
