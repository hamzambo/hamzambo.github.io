I've always been fascinated by language. I
think it's the greatest invention of the
human mind. Lately, I've been interested in
learning about the origins of names. I'll
share a couple of names in our family and
the stories behind them.

Let's start with mum. When she was born
her mother was happy that she now had a
daughter-she previously only had sons.
She promptly gave mum the name
Waris(newsworthy). The midwife called her
'Milga'(precious)*. Days later, on her
Aqeeqah, my grandfather gave her the
name Fatumazahra.

For the first few years of her life, my
grandmother spoke mostly Borana. So when
her mother would send her to get their
brother Abdullahi, she would stand at the
edge of the playing fields and shout
"'Abdullahi, Kot! Kot!" (come! come!). His
playmates baptized him Kotkota, a name
that would follow him for the rest of his life.

Some names in the family are geographical.
Two of my nieces are named after European
cities: Belfast and Berlin. Two cousins are named England. An
uncle is named after Somalia, the newly
independent country he was born in.

But we don't stop there with the
geographical names. Another cousin is
named after the continent of Asia, allegedly
because her mum thought she had asiatic
facial features. Yet another one is named
after the entire planet: Ardha(Earth).
Probably to emphasize the fact that she
was not born on Mars or one one of
Jupiter's moons.

*_The Irish surname 'Milligan' sounds similar
to my mum's name Milga. However it is
closer to the Borana name Molu. Both
Milligan and Molu mean 'bald'._
