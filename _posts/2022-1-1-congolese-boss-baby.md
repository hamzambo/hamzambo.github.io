There are a few questions one might ask about
this photo of me and my siblings. I'll answer
one : why was I dressed like an overworked congolese boss baby?

I always thought mum was responsible. 
You see, mum was a part-time tailor. One of the 
earliest memories I have is that of me
trying out a shirt mum had tailored in her
stall. I remember walking into the stall with old,
dirty and torn clothes but walking out with new outfits. 
When I started primary school, she made
my first school bag. 

But mum was meticulous in her
measurements. She made sure the clothes were
never oversized. it was out of character for her to 
make those baggy Kaunda suits for us.

Turns out the clothes my brother and I wore in
the photo were presents by one of her closest
friends. Mum did not like them. We wore them to
Uhuru Park because that particular friend was
coming with us. I think mum secretly threw them
away after that because we never saw them
again. 

As for the salute, at that point in my life I wanted
to join the police when I grew up. Specifically, I
wanted to be a driver in the police force or the army. I loved
travelling and I thought the police looked cool with
their guns, camouflage and shit.
