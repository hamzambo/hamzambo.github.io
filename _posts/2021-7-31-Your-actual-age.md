Next time someone asks how old you are,
answer "14 billion years". It doesn't matter what
your birth age is. Because that's the correct age
of everyone on earth from newborns to
centenarians. Yes, we are all age mates.
Elementally. Let me explain.

Let's start from the Big Bang. Immediately after
the Big Bang( estimated to have occurred about
14 billion years ago), hydrogen was formed. This
is the source of all hydrogen to ever exist. Then
hydrogen ions fused to form helium. These two
elements make up 99% of the the universe. The
rest of elements were formed from these two.

Now the human body is mostly composed of
water, which is mostly hydrogen. Not only that,
hydrogen was the raw material for every other
element in the body. So it is safe to say that we
are made of hydrogen. Which is 14 billion years
old. Which is your actual age.
