  I am currently interested in web development. The 
  interest was born out of necessity-I needed to build 
  my own website. I think everyone should. So, I learnt a bit of HTML and CSS. That 
  alone has helped me build this website. I am now learning Javascript.

  I am also working on improving my writing.
  I have been reading about writing and trying to 
  apply the principles learnt.
  I will post some of my essays on this website.

<p>I would like to hear from you.</p>
